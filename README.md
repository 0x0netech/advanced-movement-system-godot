# Advanced-Movement-System-Godot

This project is a template for creating advanced Third/First Person movement in GODOT;

You may use it in any other camera type like RTS, but you will need to tweak it yourself.

The Project isn't even in pre-alpha so don't expect a lot of stuff to work 

for example : there isn't any animation working yet (Just a standing mesh), the rotation system in (Looking Direction,Aiming,First Person) Mode Not working probably
